# Hi, I'm Radhika Priyadarshini 👋

### Python Beginner | Power System Engineering Enthusiast | Future Developer

I'm starting my journey as a **Python developer** with a passion for **Power System Engineering (PSE)**.  
My goal is to understand the **"black box"** behind industry tools (PSS®E, DIgSILENT) and build my own scripts for  
power flow, stability, and grid optimization.

---

### 🌱 What I'm Learning
- Python fundamentals through **Daily_Python_Learnings**
- Power System concepts: Power Flow, Economic Dispatch, Voltage Stability
- Data handling using Pandas & NumPy
- Visualizing electrical networks with Matplotlib
- Developing cloud-based energy apps using Azure

---

### 🚀 My Repos
- **Daily_Python_Learnings** – My 15+ day coding journey applying Python to PSE concepts.  
- **Power-Flow-Analysis** – Early steps in building my own solver.  
- **Economic-Dispatch-Optimization** – Exploring cost-minimization methods.  
- **Voltage-Stability-Analysis** – Understanding system limits & compensation.

---

### 🎯 Goals
- Reach intermediate Python skills by building real PSE tools.
- Learn how to model **Battery-PV-Grid hybrid systems**.
- Start exploring **AI/ML for power system analytics**.
